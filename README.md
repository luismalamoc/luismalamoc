# Hi there, I'm Luis

## About Me
I am a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead with experience in backend and cloud platforms. Currently, I am focusing on DevSecOps and my goal is to become a Cloud Security Solutions Architect. I use tools such as Terraform to automate infrastructure, manage CI/CD pipelines, and work with technologies such as AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes to design robust and secure solutions. My experience allows me to lead technical initiatives and optimize high-performance systems in enterprise environments.
